This tutorial provides an introduction to the technology of Simulation Data Management which has been developed for engineering and physics simulation over the past two decades. World leading organisations  run all their analysis, modelling and simulation on platforms with a de-facto industry standard database schema.  
A standard approach is particularly relevant to fusion, as the reactor is a highly coupled complex system, so data from each domain needs to be FAIR (Findable, Accessible. Interoperable, Reusable)  to colleagues in other domains and organisations. The use of the same schema makes it easy to search for and reference other researchers data. While most fusion-specific codes are open-source, commercial codes are widely used for Structural mechanics, fluid dynamics, etc so the data management solution should also address commercial codes. 
This tutorial explains:
•	the characteristics of physics and engineering simulations(plasma, CFD, FEA,…) from a data management perspective
•	the challenges of managing such data-sets
•	The de-facto industry-standard Simulation Data Management (SDM) data model
•	The history and evolution of the Simulation Data Management domain
•	Experience with legacy PLM vendors’ offerings
•	Extension to the SDM schema to deliver complete coverage of Digital Physics and Engineering for Modelling & Simulation
•	Information Resources available
This tutorial is also an introduction to a two day course on Digital Physics and Engineering for Modelling & Simulation
