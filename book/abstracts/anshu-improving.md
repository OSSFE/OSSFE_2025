The expectation of reproducibility is a key element of the scientific process, but it is also quite challenging to ensure in practice, especially in computational science and engineering.  This tutorial discusses some of the motivations and incentives to pay attention to reproducibility and provides ideas to help researchers improve the reproducibility of their work during and after software development, as well as during and after conducting computational experiments. The ideas in this tutorial reflect recommended best practices in scientific software development. They are generally applicable across scientific domains and are not limited to fusion energy.
