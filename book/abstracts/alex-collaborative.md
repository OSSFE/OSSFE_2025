Accurate cost estimation for fusion power plants is essential for guiding research, optimizing designs, and advancing commercialization. To address the lack of standardized cost frameworks, Woodruff Scientific LTD developed an open-source Python-based cost estimation tool with support from ARPA-E. The tool is now available in a collaborative Google Colab environment, providing a cloud-based, interactive platform for real-time collaboration, rapid prototyping, and integration into design workflows [1]. This Colab implementation enables users to explore diverse fusion device designs and performance scenarios while leveraging a modular and customizable architecture. The ongoing development of this code is supported by the Clean Air Task Force (CATF) through its International Working Group on Fusion Cost Analysis, led by Woodruff Scientific. Applications of this tool include collaborative design-to-cost exercises, automation of standardized cost documentation, and broader accessibility for the global fusion community. This presentation will demonstrate the Colab platform’s capabilities and showcase how it facilitates collaboration and innovation in fusion cost modeling.
