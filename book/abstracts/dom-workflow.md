This work presents a system modelling framework for fusion power plant design and costing, with a focus on the development and implementation of automated workflows in the Galaxy platform. The Galaxy workflows are designed to integrate parametric geometry generation with high-fidelity simulations, ensuring a streamlined, reproducible process for evaluating power plant performance, using the ARPA-E open-source fusion cost model (see Higginbottom and Ward in this meeting). Each workflow is developed to take user-defined inputs, such as design parameters and simulation settings, and execute a series of interconnected tasks, including neutronics, thermal, and electromagnetic analyses, in a fully automated manner. These workflows are built to ensure modularity, allowing engineers to customize outputs while preserving input consistency and tracking provenance. In fusion systems, where every input depends intricately on interconnected outputs, traditional methods often fail to establish consistent links across all subsystems. This framework overcomes such challenges by automating these connections, ensuring seamless interaction between components. This work benefits fusion energy researchers, system designers, and policymakers by providing a flexible, efficient, and user-friendly platform for power plant design. By simplifying the evaluation and iteration process, it accelerates the pathway toward developing cost-effective, high-performance fusion power plants

Remi: the work itself is not open source but the stack is. Maybe that's enough for a poster
