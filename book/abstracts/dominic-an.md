Plasma-impurity reaction rates are a crucial part of modelling tokamak plasmas, particularly in the scrape-off layer, where they play an important role in determining particle balance, impurity transport, energy flows, etc. Commonly used datasets for this task, such as [ADAS](https://open.adas.ac.uk/), assume Maxwellian electrons, but this assumption may be violated due to non-local parallel transport https://doi.org/10.1088/1741-4326/acdca6. There is a lack of alternatives to ADAS which are both open source and can treat non-Maxwellian electrons. For this reason, SIKE has been developed (Scrape-off layer Impurities with Kinetic Electrons): an open-source python package for atomic kinetics studies. Generating high-quality atomic data is a delicate and time-consuming task, and is largely independent from solving the rate equations, so SIKE has in-built separation between the rate equation solver and the atomic data. This, along with a straightforward JSON schema for the input data, facilitates iterative improvement in the underlying data and improves the transparency of generated outputs.
