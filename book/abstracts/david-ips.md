The IPS framework (originally the Integrated Plasma Simulator) is a Python framework to orchestrate complex multiphysics simulation workflows on HPC systems.  It has been under active development since 2008 and has been used in multiple fusion energy projects, as well as automotive engine modeling, EV battery modeling, and other application areas.  The framework is designed to support arbitrary executables wrapped as IPS components and has extremely flexible support for concurrency to facilitate maximizing HPC resource utilization for a wide range of simulations which may include components with very different resource requirements and parallel capabilities.  The IPS also supports ensembles of simulations, including parameter sweeps, optimization, uncertainty quantification, and surrogate model development.
